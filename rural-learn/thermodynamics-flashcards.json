      "front": "What is entropy?",
      "back": "A measure of disorder or randomness in a system. It tends to increase in isolated systems according to the second law of thermodynamics."

      "front": "What is an isothermal process?",
      "back": "A thermodynamic process that occurs at constant temperature. Heat is exchanged to maintain constant temperature."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "front": "What is an adiabatic process?",
      "back": "A process where no heat is exchanged between the system and surroundings. Temperature changes due to work done."

      "id": 5,
      "front": "What is the second law of thermodynamics?",
      "back": "Heat cannot flow spontaneously from a cold body to a hot body. Entropy of an isolated system always increases."

      "front": "What is the unit of entropy?",
      "back": "J/K (Joules per Kelvin) in SI units."

      "front": "What is absolute zero?",
      "back": "The lowest possible temperature (0 K or -273.15°C) where all molecular motion theoretically stops."

      "id": 9,
      "front": "What is heat engine efficiency?",
      "back": "The ratio of work output to heat input: η = W/Q_in = (Q_in - Q_out)/Q_in"

      "id": 10,
      "front": "What is the relationship between Celsius and Kelvin?",
      "back": "K = °C + 273.15. Kelvin is the absolute temperature scale starting from absolute zero."
